hello, it's a simple php gallery system. 
my gallery finds images in directory, with pagination and ajax calls in a html 5 structure.

directory structure:

|- index.php : main file
|- photos : photos directory
 |- gallery1 : a gallery directory
  |- full : full photos
  |- thumbs : thumbnail version
 |- gallery2
  |- full
  |- thumbs
|- reset.css : basic css reset
|- style.css : main css file

thumbnail images has 180x135 by default.
